## About This Site
------------------
GOTCHA! is my first simple web after a week in HACKTIV8. This site is a friendly site, kinda social media, finding friends base on same interest with the user. Like:
* Animals
* Foods
* Drinks
* Hobbies
You can connect with them and sharing good things with each other (in the future when this site become greater than this one).

## About Me
